    "# The Question\n",
    "In an old-style television picture tube (not in a modern flat-panel TV) electrons are boiled out of a very hot metal filament placed near a negative metal plate (see the figure). These electrons start out nearly at rest and are accelerated toward a positive metal plate. They pass through a hole in the positive plate on their way toward the picture screen. If the high-voltage supply in the television set maintains a potential difference of 12700 volts between the two plates, what speed do the electrons reach? (You can use the nonrelativistic approximation here.)\n",

    "> First, let's calculate the kinetic energy (KE) of the electrons when they pass through the potential difference (V) of 12,700 volts. The kinetic energy gained by the electrons is equal to the work done on them by the electric field.\n",
