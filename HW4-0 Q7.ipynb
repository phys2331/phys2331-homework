    "# The Question\n",
    "A Geiger tube, used to detect radioactive decays, contains a long thin metal wire, surrounded by a concentric long narrow metal tube. Insulating spokes hold the wire in the center of the tube and prevent electrical contact between the wire and the tube. A variable power supply is connected to the device as shown. Normally no current flows, because the tube and wire are not connected to each other. The power supply maintains opposite charges on the wire and the tube.\n",
    "\n",
    "![geiger_tube.png](images/geiger_tube.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) The electric field in the space between the wire and the outer tube is due only to the wire (the contribution due to the charges on the outer tube adds up to zero). When the electric field at any location in air reaches 3e6 volts/meter, the air ionizes and becomes a conductor. For the tube shown, the length 𝐿= 88 cm, the inner radius 𝑟= 0.6 mm, and the outer radius 𝑅= 2.5 cm. How much charge would there need to be on the inner wire in order to ionize the air near the wire (where the field is largest)?\n",
    " \n",
    "(b) When there is enough charge on the wire to ionize the air, you see a glow in the air very near the inner wire. When this happens, what is the absolute value of the potential difference along a path from the inner wire to the outer tube? (Note that the electric field in this region is not uniform.)"

Here, we have a bunch of point charges - all along the inner wire, and all over the outer tube.\n",
